            <h2>Website content auditing</h2>
            <p>Design263 takes what you currently have and builds on it, our aim is not to dismantle or disregard your current content if you already have a website, on the contrary our job is to rummage through and highlight the ‘gems’ within your content and polish that and push that to the front, after all , a web page is not  worth much if all its content is irrelevant,  or it does not inspire the impulse to find out more from your visitors. </p>
            <p>Our authors carefully tailor each individual piece of content to engage your target audience to find out more about what you have to offer. Sometimes saying the right things the right way goes a long way in converting a prospective client into a willing stakeholder in your organisations agenda.</p>

            <h2>Search Engine Optimisation</h2>


            <p>Over the years the world wide web has become more sophisticates and the way in which we view web content has changed and become more complicated as we all have individual tastes. this however has meant that search engines and they way they look at what is relevant has had to evolve to serve up the right content which is right for our individual and unique consumers values, in essence , search engines now view our websites our web pages in a much more simplistic, and are now able to tell the difference between what is good relevant content, and what is useless and time wasting rubbish.</p>

            <p>A simple consultation will leave your web pages in either in a better state as we will make recommendations as to how they can be presented better so you can move closer to the top listings, or leave you more secure in the knowledge that your website works just fine and there is nothing more you need to do except wait and see yourself climb to the top of the search  engine</p>

            <h2>Analytics and tracking</h2>
            <p>Knowing what a consumer wants puts you in a very advantageous position, it creates a predictable certainty that gives you an edge over your competitors and those around you because it makes consumers feel special, like they belong on your page, like you have struck a connection that the other websites have not, because you shave the thing that they want, or at least something very close to it.</p>
            <p>Design263 can help your web pages be set up in such a way that your visitors will leave a telling story of why some things on your website work, and why others may have been great ideas in theory, but they just did not work in practice, we will help you analyse your visitors’ habits on your website and point out what to lead with and invest more off, and look for solutions to why some ideas just don’t work in practice.</p>

            <!--(This maybe be the day when your website is just right- image goldilocks and the three bears)-->

            <p>Knowing what attracts your website visitors to your website is just as important as knowing the things about the same site that may be turning them off. This is a concept that most large firms and companies have known for a long time and having this in their armoury has proved a lethal weapon to wield in the battle for online customers and market share.</p>
            <p>Simply put, the better and easier you make your website to navigate , the more enjoyable it becomes for the end user and therefore the longer people are willing to tolerate whatever it is that you are trying to sell because they don’t have the added burden of tolerating a tedious and unthoughtful customer experience.</p>
            <p>From simple wording of statements, to positioning of buttons on a page, a lacklustre	focus on user experience issues can cause great angst while a well thought out strategy could prove to be just right  if you know what is needed to make a great website work.</p>

            <p>Making a website is like making a great dish, adding too much seasoning could prove costly while too little could be seen as boring, lacking inspiration and mundein. You need a website which if you take time and invest a little bit of effort, turns out just right.</p>
