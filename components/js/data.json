As the team lead developer our job was to also make recommendations on which technologies to put focus on and which to ignore, as well as also crerate a code repo to keep all the code in sync and up to date so as to allow collaboration from developers working remotely. We also built the master banners which were used to create multiple adapts of the same banners in multiple sizes for different devices, ensuring the animations on every banner was as per brief",
